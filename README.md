## Introduction to SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language which is used to manage data stored in relational databases like MySQL, MS Access, SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres etc.SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational database. SQL was developed in the 1970s by IBM Computer Scientists and became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. It's used in a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis. Whether you're interested in working with databases or simply want to enhance your data manipulation skills, SQL is a valuable skill to acquire.
